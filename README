Thermoled uses the parts from the Teensyduino Tutorials 1 to 4 Parts
Kit to create a gizmo that will change the color of the LED depending
on the temperature of the thermistor.  The coefficients in the program
are set so the LED is normally blue at room temperature (< 25 C).  If you grasp
the thermistor between your thumb and forefinger, the LED will change
to green ( 25 C < temp < 30 C)  and then red as its temperature
increases above 30 C.

I've not actually tested the calibration of this setup yet, although I
did put some ice and water in a thin plastic bag and was able to get
the temperature reading down to 0.8 degree C, which is very close to
what the actual temperature should have been.  Not bad for a simple
controller and thermistor.

I built and tested this with the Teensy++ 2.0 microcontroller.  Your
mileage may vary with the other models.
